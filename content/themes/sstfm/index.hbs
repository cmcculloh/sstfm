            <p>St. Stephens is a growing community of mainly converts to the Orthodox Christian Faith. We make our journey in Christ together, in prayer, worship and fellowship. We have services every Saturday night at 6:30pm, and every Sunday morning at 9:30am. We also have opportunities to pray during the week, a Wednesday night Study Group as well as special events. We offer Sunday School each week for the kids, and a Youth Group for the older kids and teens.</p>
